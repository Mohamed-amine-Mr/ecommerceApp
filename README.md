## Description

Developed a front-end e-commerce website using React.js with a focus on modern, intuitive design. Implemented `useContext` for managing the global state of the cart, `useState` for local state management such as item quantities, and utilized props for passing data between components. The project includes dynamic event handling for user interactions like adding and removing items, a responsive design, modern animations, and an interactive product filtering system.
